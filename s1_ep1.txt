Breakfast.
- S1E1
Family, right. I thought you meant of the things you eat.
- S1E1
So you thin he's gonna announce it on the boat?
- S1E1
What kind of hints?
- S1E1
Yeah, that's... that's like partner.
- S1E1
This is a real home.
- S1E1
I'd rather live like this than like my aunt and uncles whose eyes have never stung from the sweet sweat of a hard day's work.
- S1E1
From you. You say it every couple of years when they come out to visit.
- S1E1
And more! Can we buy it, Dad? Can we buy the house?
- S1E1
All right.
- S1E1
Ten cents gets you nuts. Uncle G.O.B.? Uncle G.O.B.
- S1E1
Yeah, I think I might.
- S1E1
I'm 13.
- S1E1
Yeah, I'm okay.
- S1E1
Uh, Uncle G.O.B., where's the twenty?
- S1E1
I don't need the secret. I just need the twenty.
- S1E1
Wow... It's so much like stealing.
- S1E1
It looks like a foot.
- S1E1
Hey, you’re my cousin, aren’t you?
- S1E1
We never see you. We never see anybody in our family.
- S1E1
(Laughing) Yeah... yeah... No, I-I don’t think so.
- S1E1
(Laughing) Yeah. (Continues laughing) But not really, right?
- S1E1
But we’re cousins.
- S1E1
But isn’t it against the law?
- S1E1
I know for certain that the yacht club would have a problem with it.
- S1E1
Well, it's important to be responsible. I think there aren't enough young people out there today who have a real work ethic.
- S1E1
I don't know.
- S1E1
You okay?
- S1E1
I guess we’re going to see you guys even less now.
- S1E1
I knew it was against the law.
- S1E1
Yeah, I know. I'm tempted to kiss again so we could teach 'em a lesson.
- S1E1
No, I mean, uh, to freak them out.
- S1E1
Isn't that what makes it funny? I'm laughing. Go fish' u know Okay. I just need a drink.
- S1E1
I’m packing up. What are you doing?
- S1E1
Going to miss you guys.
- S1E1
It’s been nice having you guys around. You know, to talk to. Since Mom died, it’s been kind of lonely. I just wish we could all stay here.
- S1E1
Okay. (hugs Lindsay very long)
- S1E1
He should’ve been stocking up on those “Get Out of Jail Free” cards.
- S1E1
Wish you guys didn’t have to go so soon.
