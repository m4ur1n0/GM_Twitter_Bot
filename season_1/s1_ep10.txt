Proud of me?
- S1E10
No. No, that’s not the answer. What? No. You stupid jerk. Why don’t you... Dumb. Dumb. George Michael. Dumb. Dumb.
- S1E10
Yeah. But if I fail math, there goes my chance at a good job and a happy life full of hard work, like you always say.
- S1E10
Enjoy. Tell your friends.
- S1E10
Oh, yeah. Dad told me to take the day off so I decided to come in to work.
- S1E10
She’s your girlfriend? Dad said you were her nurse.
- S1E10
Look. I have no idea where to get something like that, okay? What makes you think I would?
- S1E10
Look, I’m sorry. I can’t help you, okay? Why don’t you just ask Uncle G.O.B.?
- S1E10
That's horrible.
- S1E10
I’m working.
- S1E10
Oh. Hey!
- S1E10
Yeah. But there’s nothing to do. I mean, Maeby’s at Gangee’s...
- S1E10
Uncle G.O.B.?
- S1E10
No. No. Maybe it was the other George Michael. You know, the singer-songwriter.
- S1E10
I put that in my savings account.
- S1E10
Yeah. Save up.
- S1E10
Yeah. G.O.B. just called. He’s got the stuff at the yacht.
- S1E10
No. No. I think my dad’s on to this. I’m out. I’m not...
- S1E10
She really feels awful, huh?
- S1E10
Uncle G.O.B.?
- S1E10
No, I don’t think so.
- S1E10
What are you doing?
- S1E10
How long?
- S1E10
Oh, my God.
- S1E10
What is this?
- S1E10
But it wasn’t for me.
- S1E10
Okay, it was for me. Yeah. I was gonna smoke the marijuana like a cigarette.
- S1E10
Well, you’re always telling me to do the right thing. Family first.
- S1E10
I’m sorry.
- S1E10
Kind of. One of the Hot Cops is my choir teacher.
- S1E10
Well, I think we’re okay.
- S1E10
Like, say I had a crush on my own cousin.
