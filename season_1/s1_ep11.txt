But, Dad, you know, I might not get in, either, and that wouldn’t be the end of the world.
- S1E11
Sounds like fun.
- S1E11
I don’t mind being compared to my father.
- S1E11
You know, I have a job.
- S1E11
At the banana stand.
- S1E11
Just trying to get the TV working.
- S1E11
So when those guys kept saying “Hey, you, boy,” that was me? I was the boy?
- S1E11
No, I’m thinking of just going. I mean the graduates go on to do great things.
- S1E11
Damn, it just keeps getting worse. He’s my dad. I don’t want to disappoint him.
- S1E11
That would be amazing.
- S1E11
Oh, my God.
- S1E11
Hey, Dad.
- S1E11
Yeah, I guess.
- S1E11
Oh, no. No way. No.
- S1E11
She’s just working for us. You’re not dating her.
- S1E11
Bluth boys.
- S1E11
Good night.
- S1E11
Yeah, actually. I got a bum away from the stand without hurting his feelings. That was pretty sweet.
- S1E11
No, I want my dad to be happy.
- S1E11
Are you disappointed?
- S1E11
I didn’t want to go to that school and Jessie’s a psycho.
- S1E11
But, Dad, you know, if you ever want to date anyone else, that’s fine with me.
- S1E11
’Cause, you know, I mean, four women, that is kind of sad.
- S1E11
I mean, I know you got married in college, but that was your sophomore year. You had your whole freshman year.
- S1E11
There must’ve been girls at parties?
