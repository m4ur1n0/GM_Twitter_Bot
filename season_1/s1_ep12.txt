“Maybe tonight.” What are the chances?

How cool. So I found this. I thought it was like a one-in-a-million thing. It just made me think of you.
- S1E12
(Laughing.) Oh.

But that’s just the point. I mean, we’re cousins. You know, gender has nothing to do with it. Cousins can bunk together. That’s why they call it “bunking cousins.”

We’re not kissing, that’s the point.

Besides, I don’t even care. First you said, “Share a room with her,” I shared a room with her. Now you’re saying don’t share a room with her. Fine. I’m just... I’m just doing whatever you say. The adults are making all the decisions around here. Why am I in trouble?

You know, Maeby and I were cool with each other, and, I mean, you must really miss your wife. It’s practically still your anniversary.
- S1E12
No, don’t.

- S1E12
I’ll let you know when I get back from the lab.
