What do you mean, you couldn’t conceive?

Was Maeby adopted? Is she not really related to me? Is she just some girl I know?
- S1E13
Hey, have you ever seen any pictures of your mom pregnant?
- S1E13
Hey, you know, maybe we’re not. Because when you think about it, we don’t really even look like each other.
- S1E13
(To himself.) Maybe we’re not family. And maybe that’s very, very right, twinkie.
- S1E13
Uncle G.O.B.! Hey, uh, was Aunt Lindsay ever pregnant?
- S1E13
This was just faxed to you.
- S1E13
So, uh, I’ve been thinking about that conversation we were having the other night about, uh, where Maeby came from. And uh, I was just wondering if you could finish that thought.
- S1E13
I’m sorry, I’m going to stop you. I know what you mean. I-I didn’t mean babies in general.
- S1E13
Yeah, no, I meant specifically with Maeby.
- S1E13
I know, you’re right. I’m sorry.
- S1E13
I was never actually clear on that.
- S1E13
So, uh, it’s about Maeby.
- S1E13
Yeah. Wait, what? What do you mean pay?
- S1E13
So are you saying we’re not directly related?
- S1E13
This family can be pretty screwed up sometimes. But the good news is, I just found out...
- S1E13
Well, have you explored all the alternatives, because I guess what I’m getting at...
- S1E13
Yeah, you got us, all right.
