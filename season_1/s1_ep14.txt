This is my Ethics essay. I’m supposed to write 200 words on the morality of war—whether a preemptive strike is ever justified.

I’m not sure my Ethics teacher would love if I cheated on my essay.
- S1E14
Oh. No ring.
- S1E14
Oh, yeah, Dad. And, Dad, try to remember everything she says about me.
- S1E14
I can’t. I don’t want to let down Miss Baerly. She’s nice, you know?
- S1E14
Well, I don’t know why I’m telling you this. I guess there’s just some things you can’t always say to your dad.
- S1E14
You’re my aunt.
- S1E14
Yeah. I just made this for her.
- S1E14
Yeah, she loves Saddam Hussein.
- S1E14
Right. That’s what I meant.
- S1E14
You know, I just wanted to make her something special to show that I care.
- S1E14
No, I mean about her.
- S1E14
I kind of love her.
- S1E14
No, no. I mean, like, love her, love her.
- S1E14
Dad, what was she doing here? I mean, she wasn’t...
- S1E14
Why would he do that? Why would G.O.B. sleep with my Ethics teacher?
- S1E14
How would that be getting even with you? I’m the one that likes her.
- S1E14
We don’t even know how old she is. No one does. She was chaperoning the Diversity Dance and I thought, like, maybe as a joke thing, I’d go up to her and be like, “Oh, hey, do you want to dance?” And she’d be like, “Eh, what the heck,” right? Or something, I don’t know. I did it differently in the mirror, but...
- S1E14
Like, it would like be joke dancing or something. I didn’t think it through.
- S1E14
I feel so stupid. I defaced a rare book to get that picture of Saddam Hussein in a bathing suit.
- S1E14
Yeah. Yeah, you know something? You’re right. G.O.B.’s going to pay.
- S1E14
The cheerleader?
- S1E14
You know, maybe we should go together. All right, I mean, it’s a bad example, I just... but should we?
- S1E14
Oh, great, another uncle to compete with.
- S1E14
Uncle G.O.B.
- S1E14
I’m looking for you. How could you do this to me?
- S1E14
Yeah, my Ethics teacher.
- S1E14
Dad, I’m taking care of something okay? (To G.O.B.) You slept with my Ethics teacher.
- S1E14
Hey, what’s going on here, Dad?
- S1E14
Well, didn’t Aunt Lindsay tell you that I liked her?
- S1E14
I can’t believe that would have worked.
