Surely’s dying?

Maeby, someone’s going to get hurt. Not to mention it’s kind of disrespectful for kids who actually have this.

What does that stand for?
- S1E17
I told you someone would get hurt.

It’s just a sprain, but at least it’s legitimate.
- S1E17
Well, not up the bleachers.

I just thought I’d come down and see the family. See everyone.

She kind of lied to me.
- S1E17
It’s just so hard to know what the right thing to do is.
- S1E17
I need to talk to you.
- S1E17
Surely can beat this thing!
