That’s amazingly close.
- S1E18
Okay, that’s amazing.
- S1E18
No, no, but, I mean, if that had been the actual card, I’m pretty sure I’d be almost too blown away.
- S1E18
Your presentation is great.
- S1E18
No, we’re off for two weeks, Dad. G.O.B.’s teaching me some new tricks.
- S1E18
Wow. He’s amazing.
- S1E18
Yeah. I don’t care. I’m loving the ride, you know? (To G.O.B.) So how you going to do it?
- S1E18
But that’s not the end of the trick. There’s a big surprise coming.
- S1E18
Oh, you changed the trick. It’s a different trick.
- S1E18
Hang on, Dad, we’re in the middle of something.
- S1E18
Dad, it’s misdirection. You’re supposed to keep your eye on the shirt in the hat.
- S1E18
I’m dying to see how he makes this yacht disappear.
- S1E18
No, but it’s driving me crazy. It’s like a mind puzzle, an awesome mind puzzle.
- S1E18
Well, I don’t know, Dad. I really wanted to see G.O.B.’s magic show and...
- S1E18
You know, it’s just...
- S1E18
Good afternoon, Bluth Company. Talk you off? Talk you off of what, Pop-Pop?
- S1E18
I think Dad fired her again. He wants to talk to you.
- S1E18
You heard? Yeah, all right.
- S1E18
Well, if I clean it up, it’s not really a sentence.
- S1E18
So, what was it like out there today?
- S1E18
Well, I’ll be working here, so I guess I’ll never know.
- S1E18
Yeah, but then if he makes it disappear, won’t everyone just see me standing there?
- S1E18
Hey, Uncle G.O.B. I came by to see if you needed any help with your magic show.
- S1E18
I think it’s so great that you’re doing this.
- S1E18
So how’d you get my Dad’s permission?
- S1E18
Bluth Company, George Michael speaking, not Kitty.
- S1E18
Yeah, well, I don’t need a real spring break. I really think I am much better off here alone in this office.
- S1E18
Really? Can you fire people?
- S1E18
Thanks, Dad. Are you sure you’re going to be okay without Kitty?
