So, uh, you know, if you want me on wood block, I-I can keep perfect time. Some call me “The Human Metronome.” You notice how I’m always on time? I’m never late for things.

No, it’s not. No, it’s the exact same thing. It’s knowing how long things take.

We’ve been talking here for 28 seconds, just so you know.
- S1E19
No, I just thought I would join in on the fun. I mean, you guys are always talking about, you know, family and loving and having good times in the circle...
- S1E19
Why, what did I do?
- S1E19
Anyway, I thought you hated fishing.
- S1E19
Oh, we get to eat it?
- S1E19
What are you guys doing here?
- S1E19
Sure sounds like they’re having fun out there by the pool.
- S1E19
Good night, Dad.
- S1E19
Hey, Dad?
- S1E19
Dad, are you still awake?
- S1E19
It’s just, um... I mean, this is really fun and everything...
- S1E19
Yeah. The problem I’m having is, uh... I have got a pretty finely tuned internal clock...
- S1E19
It’s actually why I’m such a good natural percussionist. And, um... I’m just... worried that I’m not going to be able to fall asleep for another two hours and 45 minutes. So I was thinking maybe I would go down and check out Maeby’s band? You could g see if G.O.B.’s bachelor party has started.
- S1E19
It’s just I don’t know when I’m gonna get another chance like this, you know, to be there for family. I’d hate to miss it because I was too proud.
- S1E19
Actually that part was kind of just for you. I was just worried the whole thing wasn’t going to land unless I included the pride part.
