Pop-Pop? Oh, sorry, Miss. Pop-Pop?

But with hair. Which is probably why he asked for my hair, remember?
- S1E20
Of course! You’re mocking me.
- S1E20
I know what I saw, Maeby, and there’s no other explanation.
- S1E20
Isn’t this the same sign you used to picket the cable company when they dropped the Style Network?
- S1E20
Oh, right. Pop-Pop! With hair!
- S1E20
You know, I should tell my dad.
- S1E20
Who’s... who’s disappeared?
- S1E20
I’ve seen no one!
- S1E20
No. Why? Has someone who looks like Pop-Pop disappeared?
- S1E20
We thought you broke out of prison and were on the lam with stolen hair.
- S1E20
But don’t worry. We would never blow the whistle on family.
