Hey, don’t forget me.

It’s Bring Your Daughter to Work Day. Unless you had a daughter I don’t know about, I’m your girl.
- S1E21
Hey, Dad. They’re out of sanitary napkins in the ladies washroom. (Laughing.)
- S1E21
Yeah, right. Pretty soon I’m going to have to start wearing a bra. Right, Dad? All right, give me one minute.
- S1E21
Hey dad. Do you think this purse goes with this outfit? Where’d my dad go?
- S1E21
You know, I make these jokes about being a daughter for my dad, and I know I’m a man. It’s his insecurity, not mine.
- S1E21
Yeah, I can hang out with my uncles. I mean, three men. What’s butcher than that?
- S1E21
Yeah, maybe a new pair of shoes will cheer me up.
- S1E21
What are we getting? Is it something for a magic trick?
- S1E21
You know, it’s so great to be hanging out with you. There are certain things that I can talk to you about that I can’t really with my dad, like, uh... were-were you ever awkward around girls?
- S1E21
You’re saying I should just be myself?
- S1E21
You know, say what you will about America. 13 bucks still gets you a hell of a lot of mice.
- S1E21
Yeah, well, I meant... So what are the mice for?
- S1E21
Shirts? G.O.B., are we shoplifting?
- S1E21
Hey, Dad, I didn’t know we were shoplifting, okay?
- S1E21
Yeah, and you got caught by a 13-year-old girl.
- S1E21
Yeah, well, it’s not like you were there to spend any time with me, Dad, ’cause I’m not daughter enough for you.
- S1E21
Dad, that’s what makes it funny.
- S1E21
Yeah, well, I guess you looking out for her is probably something she could use.
