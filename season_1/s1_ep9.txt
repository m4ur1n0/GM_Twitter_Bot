What are you doing?
- S1E9
Wow, that’s pretty cool you know how to do all that stuff.
- S1E9
People can take chairs home from work?
- S1E9
Yeah, but isn’t that why Grandpa’s in jail, because he took things from work?
- S1E9
I mean, a chair costs money so it’s like stealing and you always say...
- S1E9
Crazy. Wait, who is? Which...?
- S1E9
So, I’m thinking of getting a motorcycle.
- S1E9
Yeah, I’m gonna need a leather jacket for when I’m on my hog and need to go into a controlled slide.
- S1E9
You’ve just got to really dig.
- S1E9
If you ever need to borrow any money...
- S1E9
I didn’t notice.
- S1E9
Excuse me.
- S1E9
Hey, Dad.
- S1E9
Yeah. I was just going for a new look.
- S1E9
Trying to introduce some edge to the whole palette.
- S1E9
You did?
- S1E9
I wish you’d told me that before I threw away my windbreaker. Oh, you bought a chair.
- S1E9
Well, I thought we decided that was like stealing.
- S1E9
It’s like you said. You can’t change who you are. So what? So I don’t have any hair on my arms or legs. So what? You know, a leather jacket’s not going to change that. You know, I was trying to act like a tough guy, and it’s wrong. I’m just a boring, old nice guy like you.
- S1E9
Yeah, and if this is about the chair, I’ve been thinking. You deserve it. You know, it’s not like you’d ever steal something big.
- S1E9
I’m okay with myself, I’m okay with myself. I’m okay...
