It’s called the Promise Land. You’re supposed to make promises about your relationship as a tribute to the generations that preceded you. Hey, there’s booze in this.

We’re just looking for the camping stuff. Hey, do you know where the pump is for the air mattress?
- S2E13
What? Why? Is this because I’d miss school?
- S2E13
I don’t know. You won’t let me go.
- S2E13
King me. Oh, my God.
- S2E13
Oh, me, too.
- S2E13
What? No, no. You would have won that.
- S2E13
Can it open a can?
- S2E13
Oh, God.
- S2E13
Actually, I just wanted to spend some time with my knuckle Buster.
- S2E13
(Mumbles.) Oh, my God.
- S2E13
Well, I was actually supposed to go away to the Promise Land this weekend, but my dad didn’t want me to. Family first.
- S2E13
You know, maybe I should let my dad know that we’re here.
- S2E13
Yeah, but... maybe I’ll just give him a call.
- S2E13
Well, I’m not a... not an orphan. I have a dad.
- S2E13
But they haven’t served dinner yet.
- S2E13
You were supposed to do it?
- S2E13
I appreciate you taking me here to see Anne.
- S2E13
Yeah. Oh, yeah, oh, yeah.
- S2E13
And I saw some of those people. That was a very competitive category.
