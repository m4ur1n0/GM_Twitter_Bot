My hand! You cut of my hand!

But I don’t think I’m ready.
- S2E14
I’m going to lose it before I start.
- S2E14
Ann thinks I should run for student body president.
- S2E14
I don’t have a chance. I mean, they only vote for the cool kids.
- S2E14
Ann, if my dad says that he won, then he won.
- S2E14
All right, I’ll do it! I’m in.
- S2E14
I’m pumped.
- S2E14
It took me all day, but I got the ten signatures I needed. I’m running for student body president.
- S2E14
I couldn’t have done this without you guys. I’m going to win this thing.
- S2E14
And I don’t want to make Steve look bad.
- S2E14
She’s wh... Ann? I think she’s really upset about this.
- S2E14
My tape?
- S2E14
That’s why you had me do that?
- S2E14
No, Steve dropped out of the race. He says he wants to spend some time trying to find his real father. Rav Nadir, the Indian kid, he got 97% percent of the vote.

No, I tied with “Bart Simpson” and “School Sucks.”
- S2E14
It’s just a drag. I mean, I’m pretty sure my girlfriend’s gone forever. I never wanted to do this in the first place.
- S2E14
I’ve only gotten better.
- S2E14
Wow, I’d love that. Thanks, Ann. You really make me feel good about myself.
