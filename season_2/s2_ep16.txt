Gangy's having an anniversary party?
- S2E16
Is Franklin gonna be there?
- S2E16
I just don't want him to point out my cracker ass in front of Ann.
- S2E16
Do you think my mom's engagement ring is still around?
- S2E16
I'm thinking of asking Ann to get pre-engaged.
- S2E16
Yeah. I feel like God moved her here from Ohio to be with me.
- S2E16
Hey, Dad, can you drive me to Ann’s?
- S2E16
Great. I’ll wait in the car.
- S2E16
I told you.
- S2E16
What are you doing, Dad?
- S2E16
Ann just called. They had a pre-dawn mass. Then they were going to mass, so...
- S2E16
You know, it’s really great you did this. I-I thought you didn’t really even like Ann, but you know, since you do, I thought I could get your opinion. I was thinking of giving her, like, a-a pre-engagement...
- S2E16
All right, well, yeah. You know, I guess it did kind of feel right to me, but, yeah, if you... I’ve got to trust you, right?
- S2E16
Yeah. Hey, maybe I should... maybe I should ask if she wants to get pre-pre-engaged. Add another...
- S2E16
Oh, yeah, I’m not going to do it now.
- S2E16
Plan? What plan?
- S2E16
You know what? I can’t believe my dad. First, he’s saying I need to respect the sanctity of marriage, and then, he’s making out with her on the balcony.
- S2E16
No, no. Mrs. Veal. Know what else he’s not gonna like? I am getting pre-engaged.
- S2E16
To hell with him.
- S2E16
Ann, I-I have something to ask you. Well, I-I really like you. I guess what I-I want to ask you is, will you one day, uh, intend to marry me? And it would be great to hear back on this before the real hard A.P. stuff kicks in, you know?
- S2E16
Right now?
- S2E16
Yeah. That's okay, Dad. You know we were talking, and we think that we were doin' it for the wrong reasons.
- S2E16
Do you mean it?
- S2E16
Thanks, Dad.
