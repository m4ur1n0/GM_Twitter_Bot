Oh, wow. Hey, can I bring Ann?
- S2E2
Ann. You know, she’s... She’s the girl I’m kind of hanging out with.
- S2E2
Yes, you have.
- S2E2
You let her in. See, that’s ... That’s her right over there.
- S2E2
Oh, it’s so cute. She sometimes takes a little pack of mayonnaise, and she’ll squirt it in her mouth all over, and then she’ll take an egg and kind of... Mmmm! She calls it a “mayonegg.” Are you okay?
- S2E2
You know, I kind of want to buy her a diamond.
- S2E2
Ann. I know I can’t afford it, but Aunt Lindsay was telling me about this diamond cream...
- S2E2
But I thought G.O.B. was president now.
- S2E2
I want to buy Ann some diamond dust.
- S2E2
No, and I can’t find that diamond dust that Aunt Lindsay bought for me.
- S2E2
This is your chance, huh, with the big ribbon-cutters? After all these years...
