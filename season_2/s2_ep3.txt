Oh, I can’t; I’m meeting Ann.
- S2E3
She’s kind of my girlfriend.
- S2E3
Do you not like her?
- S2E3
Fun party, huh?
- S2E3
All right, let me grab Ann real quick.
- S2E3
Yeah, I invited her. You-you said you wanted to spend time some with her. You said I was being an Ann hog.
- S2E3
It’s just Ann.
- S2E3
All right.
- S2E3
What was that?
- S2E3
Hey, Dad? Dad?
- S2E3
What do you think of Ann so far?
- S2E3
Yeah, okay, I have an idea. When we go back, why don’t just the two of you go back in the staircar together?
- S2E3
Great! Yes! Okay! I’ll tell Maeby that I’ll be going back with her and Aunt Lindsay. Great.
- S2E3
So, uh, you guys have a good talk?
- S2E3
No, I meant... Wait, you wouldn’t have a problem with that? Nothing! No, I was talking about Ann. What’d you think of her?
- S2E3
I just want to find Ann.
- S2E3
Oh, my...
- S2E3
Way to plant, Ann.
- S2E3
What a scare.
- S2E3
Where’s Uncle G.O.B.?
