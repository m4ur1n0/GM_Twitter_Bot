Oh, Ann came to see me, so I thought I’d take a little break. Can we talk about this later?
- S2E4
I’m sorry. Hello?
- S2E4
Yeah, that’s great.
- S2E4
I’m actually still talking with Ann.
- S2E4
That’s good.
- S2E4
What? What, is Ann telling everyone?
- S2E4
Are you okay?
- S2E4
Nothing. I just... I broke up with her. It’s no big deal.
- S2E4
Me? I’m great.
- S2E4
I’m great.
- S2E4
No, she’s a great girl.
- S2E4
You think there are other guys?
- S2E4
They’re perfect.
- S2E4
Yeah, I know. I can’t not tell my father.
- S2E4
I understand what that feels like. I was dumped today. And the bad part is, I can’t even tell my dad how upset I am about it, because he’ll think that I should just be upset about you.
- S2E4
Yeah. Okay.
- S2E4
I was just going to... eat some of my grandfather’s favorite foods in my room. That’s the form that my grief is taking.
- S2E4
I’m probably not going to say it to him.
- S2E4
Oh, my God, that’s Ann.
- S2E4
It’s the girl who ripped my heart out. The girl whose face will always be etched in my mind.
- S2E4
She’s really funny.
- S2E4
Ann... did dad invite you?
- S2E4
You think we really do?
- S2E4
Yeah? Wow. He’s really gone. But you know, I think that if he was here right now, I would probably tell him that it all worked out. And that, um, I’ll be bringing you some salmon rolls right away. In heaven.
- S2E4
That was great.
- S2E4
I have Pop-Pop in the attic.
- S2E4
I’m sorry. You know, from now on, we’ll just tell the truth to each other.
- S2E4
Actually, she broke up with me. But the great thing is, that she was so moved by what you said tonight that we’re back together.
