Hey. Hey, Dad, you ready for the prosecutor?
- S2E5
Oh, it was okay, I guess, but I don’t know. It was weird; I studied with Ann, but I still got a B-minus.
- S2E5
Well, it wasn’t Ann. She’s an expert in math. Isn’t that cute?
- S2E5
No, it wasn’t Ann’s fault. You know, I think I just ended up thinking about the-the questions too long, and then by the time I put an answer down, I went with, like, my fifth choice or something like that.
- S2E5
I think maybe sitting in the back of the class with Ann is a bad idea. You know, she’s just so pretty... I get distracted, I guess.
- S2E5
I wish I could draw her nose.
- S2E5
No, I said I was in the back of the classroom, but still, no, no...
- S2E5
Well, I don’t know, maybe.
- S2E5
Two. No, no, one.
- S2E5
Three. Unless three is too much of an improvement. I’m sorry, is one... is one in the mix still?
- S2E5
Oh. Hi.
- S2E5
Cool. So, I got a “C” on my math test. Not anticipating a good reaction on that.
- S2E5
It’s possible.
- S2E5
Steve Holt? I thought you liked him.
- S2E5
I think I blew the eye exam too, because every time I take these off, I feel better.
- S2E5
Hey, I, I’ve seen this before.
- S2E5
Uh, there’s a ladder.
