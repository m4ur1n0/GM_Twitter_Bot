I know. I can’t. I’m supposed to go to Ann’s parents’ Christmas party. We’re making yams.
- S2E6
Well, did you want me to go to that? You’re always telling me not to have fun at those things.
- S2E6
Oh... kay. Well, um... Well, I think Ann’s parents are having their party on Bethlehem time, which is pretty early, so maybe I can make an appearance.
- S2E6
It’s Ann.
- S2E6
Aunt Lindsay. How’s the party?
- S2E6
Oh, it was... it was good. They’re kind of... religious, Ann’s parents, so it was... yeah, it was just kind of...
- S2E6
Oh, okay.
- S2E6
Hey, Dad.
- S2E6
No, no, they said I could leave for the second hour of silent prayer. But Ann and I do have to go back, so I should... I should go soon.
- S2E6
Neither does my dad.
- S2E6
You’re not going to believe this. Apparently, my dad and Maeby took a drive up the coast.
- S2E6
Yeah, now my dad’s got a new kid.
- S2E6
Well, what can you do, right?
- S2E6
Hey, can I give you a hand?
- S2E6
So, um, I’m sorry about...
- S2E6
Yeah, well, me, too.
- S2E6
It is catchy.
- S2E6
Right. That’s the thing.
