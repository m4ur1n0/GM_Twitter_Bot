Dad. Hey.
- S3E1
I didn’t want to miss you because you’ve been leaving so early lately.
- S3E1
Oh, hi.
- S3E1
I’m off to the car.
- S3E1
Can you afford to skip work?
- S3E1
We’re up from “Sell”? It’s happening, isn’t it?
- S3E1
It’s not happening, is it?
- S3E1
Right, but the cabin’s in Lake Tahoe. So I’m saying that’s right near Reno. We could just...
- S3E1
What?! No!
- S3E1
Neither am I.
- S3E1
She's turning again!
- S3E1
It's because we didn't finish the kiss? Is that where... Yeah.
- S3E1
Do you think we should just finish the kiss, get it out of the way?
- S3E1
Oh, you... Yeah, I'm gonna, um, I'm gonna stay out here and, uh, and watch that famous Reno sunset.
- S3E1
There's... Yeah, but there's mirrors. It'll actually look closer...
- S3E1
It’s never happening.
- S3E1
Me, too.
- S3E1
Yeah. Or, or we could go back to Reno.
- S3E1
That’s not totally true, though. I’m just in the middle of a problem right now.
- S3E1
I can’t talk about it with you.
- S3E1
It’s just, it’s about a girl, and you’re not gonna like this.
- S3E1
No. It... It's just, it's a problem without an answer.
- S3E1
Yeah, I guess so.
- S3E1
You know, I'm really glad you brought me here, Dad.
