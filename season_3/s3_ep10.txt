How is he?
- S3E10
I heard there’s a mall across the street.
- S3E10
Would I have to touch the old people?
- S3E10
Oh, I don’t have a girlfriend.
- S3E10
Good. I... great. I was just... Well, don’t answer for... I, um, yeah. ’Cause I know exactly the cousin, I mean, the.. the girl I would want to give and she’ll want give too. We’ll... and we’ll do that together. For them, for the sake of... I ju... it’s a great day. For being sad.
- S3E10
Well, that was a long time ago.

A film?
- S3E10
Oh, well, yeah.
- S3E10
But, we aren’t...
- S3E10
What are we going to do?
- S3E10
Oh! You know about this room, too?
- S3E10
Um, yeah, I-I come here to think myself sometimes, you know. I mean, I always knock first. I-I always do that. I always do that anyway, no matter what room. So, um, what happened back there?
- S3E10
Well, you know the Torah tells us that the larger wrong is to put our own feelings before the commitments we’ve made. You know, towards the sick, aged and gross.
- S3E10
And I mean you know, we weren’t there for ourselves today. We were there to bring happiness to others. And... I just... I just feel now like we left a lot of old people sad there today.
- S3E10
I mean, you know, I’m not saying it’s not weird for me, too. I’m just saying maybe we could take those weird feelings and turn them into something positive.
- S3E10
Let’s freak them out!
