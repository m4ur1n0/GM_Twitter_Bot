Including me?

Oh. (Chuckling nervously.) Yeah, , I... Um, hey, speaking of that, uh... it’s actually her birthday soon, so I thought we could all do something for her.
- S3E12
Maeby’s. I was changing the subject. We— no, yeah, we weren’t talking about Maeby. But she’s been feeling kind of left out of the family lately so I thought maybe we could throw her a surprise party, you know.
- S3E12
Oh, no, vodka doesn’t...
- S3E12
But they’re planning a surprise party for you. They wouldn’t forget your 16th birthday.
- S3E12
16, actually.
- S3E12
You see, sometimes shame can be fun.
- S3E12
Secrets. You said “shame.” He said “shame.”
- S3E12
So he’s actually in an Iraqi prison?
- S3E12
Do you have go by yourself?
- S3E12
But would you be back in time for Maeby’s surprise party?
- S3E12
Well, be careful
- S3E12
I don’t think Steve Holt has to come to this.
- S3E12
Yeah. I’m really sorry they didn’t come. I don’t know what happened.
- S3E12
What are you talking about?
- S3E12
Well, is that why you’ve been so stressed out all the time?
- S3E12
What, you’re going to drink?
- S3E12
Well, I guess if you can run a studio.
- S3E12
It’s good.
- S3E12
Look, I’m Uncle Buster.
- S3E12
I’m sorry no one from the family came.
- S3E12
No, don’t... no... I’ve never wanted to say this... but you might not even be related to us.
- S3E12
’Cause Gangee once said to me, your mom might not have ever even been pregnant with you.
- S3E12
No, I’m... I wouldn’t. Everyone still loves you. Some more than others.
