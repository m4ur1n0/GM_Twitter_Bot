Kind of.
- S3E13
And there’s a chance you might not even be related to us.
- S3E13
Yeah, you think that’s a bad idea?
- S3E13
Does that... not work for your schedule? I mean, I’m sure we can control our, you know... I’m going to go sleep with my dad.
- S3E13
So Pop-Pop is definitely innocent, huh?
- S3E13
Actually... I’ve been wrestling with some pretty taboo...
- S3E13
I’m really happy. Hey, I wonder if we should move out of town.
- S3E13
I feel like we’ve heard this whole “out of the woods” thing a lot, you know, and-and I just wouldn’t mind...
- S3E13
Well, I’ve heard that a couple times, too.
- S3E13
What? What? We can’t have kids! What’s the matter...? What are you...? I mean it’s not even an option, really.
- S3E13
Sure, I may want to, you know, now. I-It doesn’t matter. Either way, I won’t do anything about it. Come on!
- S3E13
Hey, Dad.
- S3E13
Well, you said we could... we could talk later.
- S3E13
I actually might even just skip that.
- S3E13
Maeby and I made out.
- S3E13
Me, too.
- S3E13
Even a little more than that. I thought she wasn’t my real cousin, but then Uncle Tobias showed us these really rough pictures that proved that she was really Aunt Lindsay’s daughter. I just feel like I can’t be around her or Aunt Lindsay. They were really rough... pictures.
- S3E13
I mean, I know it’s wrong, you know, but, uh, my feelings are real even... even if it was a mistake.
- S3E13
I know. I’ve seen the blood.
- S3E13
I don’t know. 53 weeks? I can’t be around her with these feelings anymore, and that’s why I’m-I’m not going to this party.
- S3E13
Uncle G.O.B.?
- S3E13
My Dad said that you were living down here with your girlfriend.
- S3E13
I can't stay here. Ann's moved on. Maeby's my cousin. And we both know that's not an option.
- S3E13
Why didn't you tell me this?
- S3E13
Well, I guess we should go back. Family sticks together, huh?
