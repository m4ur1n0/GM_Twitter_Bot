Another date with Steve Holt?
- S3E3
Good. I was hoping he would be gifted sexually. I guess it makes sense, you know, older guys expect certain things.
- S3E3
What a fun, sexy time for you.
- S3E3
Steve Holt? What, the moron jock?
- S3E3
Wait, so that means that Steve Holt is my cousin? And Maeby’s cousin, too?
- S3E3
So are you.
- S3E3
She’s your cousin, too.
- S3E3
What have you guys been doing?
- S3E3
He’s your cousin.
- S3E3
I should have told you that. Now you’ve drugged him and had your way with him. How is that even possible?
- S3E3
Well, I think even the anti-drug people are going to be okay with that.
- S3E3
You took his pants off?
