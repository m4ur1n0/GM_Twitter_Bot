But we’re not good at that stuff.

I’m supposed to go fabric shopping with Ann today.
- S3E4
Uh, uh, no. We’re making a gown. She’s gonna be in a beauty pageant.
- S3E4
My-My girlfriend. She’s... You’ve met her so many times— met her and met her...
- S3E4
That’s her. Her name isn’t Annabelle, that’s Ann.
- S3E4
She’s in it. She’s a contestant. It’s sort of like an inner beauty pageant.
- S3E4
My Ann? No, I don’t think we need any help.
- S3E4
Hey, what are you doing, Maeby?
- S3E4
What happened to your nose?
- S3E4
You know, she has a really lovely singing voice.
- S3E4
No, that sounds a bit racy.
- S3E4
No, I’m not afraid of sex...
- S3E4
Well... turns out Ann doesn’t want me around during it.
- S3E4
Hey, now you and me can go to that fair together tomorrow, after all.
- S3E4
Yeah, do some man stuff.
- S3E4
Oh, okay, great, yeah, I did want to do that with you.
- S3E4
You don’t think I’m manly?
- S3E4
Well, congratulations on coming in third. That's amazing. And I heard you're the first camel act to ever crack the top ten, too, so that's like a record. And I'm a bit relieved, because, um... I was... I thought maybe if you came in first you would have outgrown me.

I’m becoming a man, Dad. Isn’t that what everybody wants?
- S3E4
No, it’s good, Dad. There’s all sorts of benefits, and it’s like a family... but it’s also an army of one. And it’s no place for wimps.
- S3E4
I think I’m gonna go get one of those corn dog crosses.
- S3E4
Right. Thanks, Dad.
