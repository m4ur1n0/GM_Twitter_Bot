What? Yeah... fine. Uh, yes, I don’t care. What’s up?
- S3E9
Yeah, I’m just taking a three real quick, so I can get a cream soda.
- S3E9
No, I will get it. I have to get it myself. Just, relax... just check the stove.
- S3E9
Burners are still off and I re-washed all the clothes.
- S3E9
My name is George Michael Bluth. I’m a 16-year-old Caucasian male. My mom died. And I guess that’s it.
- S3E9
I thought you looked like that guy Andy Richter. You guys are identical twins?
- S3E9
Will this go toward my grade?
- S3E9
What do we get for that?
- S3E9
Can you think of anything critical to say about my dad?
- S3E9
You know it might help if you expressed yourself.
- S3E9
He pretends he’s the great father all of a sudden and acts like he’s all worried about me, but it turns out he just does it so I can help him with his joke of a career. No wonder Mom wanted out so bad.
- S3E9
Oh, my God.
- S3E9
Is this because I cheated off Maeby? Because I’ve never done that before, Dad, I swear. I just couldn’t think of anything to write about you, so I asked her to write it about her dad.
- S3E9
Yeah, it was stupid of me. Now Donnie’s met you. I mean, he’s never going to believe that you were ever up for a part in Wicked.
- S3E9
No, I wasn’t...
- S3E9
Let go of my dad you’re going to hurt him.
- S3E9
It could’ve been the Muffin Man. They never caught him.
- S3E9
So, Dad, you saw that? I thought you didn’t know what I said about you.
- S3E9
Well, no, you know what? I think Donnie was right. I just wasn’t digging deep enough. I think I might’ve meant what I said. You never listen to me. You didn’t ask me if I wanted to go to the school, you didn’t ask me about what I said. You threatened my teacher. You don’t respect me. How can I respect you, man?
- S3E9
Yeah, well, it was wrong of me to say what I did about how I felt.
- S3E9
You’d do great at Openings.
- S3E9
OCD? No, I’m just cleaning up after Aunt Lindsay. She never turns things off.
- S3E9
I love my cousin.
